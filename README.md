## About myself

I'm a front-end software engineer that has experience in building web or mobile applications with JavaScript and still trying to expand my knowledge and learn new technologies to develop high-quality software for end-user. I have a background in Sharia Finance and Banking Management, with internship experience in a couple of financial institutions before I shifted my career and started to learn code for my current career.
